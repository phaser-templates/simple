# phaser-simple-boilerplate

> The simplest possible Phaser setup in a single HTML file

### Before You Start...

This boilerplate is targeted at beginners who want to start exploring Phaser without the distraction of a complicated development environment.

For advanced features such as asset compilation, hot-reload, lint-on-save, unit testing, and CSS extraction, we recommend that more experienced developers use one of the [other templates](https://github.com/phaser-templates/).

## Usage

This is a project template for [phaser-cli](https://github.com/nerdenough/phaser-cli).

``` bash
$ npm install -g phaser-cli      # Install phaser-cli if you haven't already
$ phaser init simple my-project  # Create a new project based on this template
$ cd my-project                  # Navigate into your new project folder

$ npm install -g http-server     # Install http-server if you haven't already
$ http-server                    # Run http-server and open it in your browser
```

### Fork It And Make Your Own

You can [fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to create your own boilerplate, and use it with `phaser-cli`:

``` bash
phaser init username/repo my-project
```
